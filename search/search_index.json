Materials Preserved DNA sample from swab Lysis Additive A Binding buffer I 70% Ethanol Binding Buffer B Wash Solution A Elution Buffer B DNA spin columns 65\u02daC water bath Ice 1.5ml tubes Centrifuge Steps Protocol C Part I - Preparing swab sample Add 100 \u03bcL of Lysis Additive A to the swab collection tube and vortex briefly. Incubate the swab collection tube at 65\u02daC for 5 minutes. Carefully remove the swab from the collection tube. Label a microcentrifugue tube and transfer up to 1 mL of the preserved sample to the microcentrifuge tube. Centrifuge the tube for 2 minutes at 20,000 \u00d7 g (~14,000 RPM). A thin white layer will form on the top of the supernatant. Label a new microcentrifuge tube and carefully transfer 700 \u03bcL of supernatant, without the white layer debris, to the microcentrifuge tube. Add 100 \u03bcL of Binding Buffer I, mix by inverting the tube a few times, and incubate for 10 minutes on ice. Spin the lysate for 2 minutes at 20,000 x g (~14,000 RPM) to pellet any cell debris. Label a new microcentrifuge tube. Using a pipette, transfer up to 700 \u03bcL of supernatant (avoid contacting the pellet with the pipette tip) into the new microcentrifuge tube. Add an equal volume of 70% ethanol to the lysate collected above (100 \u03bcL of ethanol is added to every 100 \u03bcL of lysate). Vortex to mix. Part II - binding DNA to column Assemble a spin column with one of the provided collection tubes. Apply 700 \u03bcL of the clarified lysate with ethanol onto the column and centrifuge for 1 minute at 10,000 x g (~10,000 RPM). Discard the flowthrough and reassemble the spin column with the collection tube. Note Ensure the entire lysate volume has passed through into the collection tube by inspecting the column. If the entire lysate volume has not passed, spin for an additional minute at 20,000 x g (~14,000 RPM). Repeat step 2 with the remaining volume of lysate mixture. Part III - wash column Apply 500 \u03bcL of Binding Buffer B to the column and centrifuge for 1 minute at 10,000 x g (~10,000 RPM). Note Ensure the entire Binding Buffer B has passed through into the collection tube by inspecting the column. If the entire wash volume has not passed, spin for an additional minute. Discard the flowthrough and reassemble the spin column with its collection tube. Apply 500 \u03bcL of Wash Solution A to the column and centrifuge for 1 minute at 10,000 x g (~10,000 RPM). Discard the flowthrough and reassemble the spin column with its collection tube. Repeat steps 3 and 4. Spin the column for 2 minutes at 20,000 x g (~14,000 RPM) in order to thoroughly dry the resin. Discard the collection tube. Part IV - Elute DNA Place the column into a fresh 1.7 mL Elution tube provided with the kit. Add 50 \u03bcL of Elution Buffer B to the column. Centrifuge for 1 minute at 425 x g (~2,000 RPM), followed by a 1 minute spin at 20,000 x g (~14,000 RPM).

Be careful not to disturb the cell pellet at the bottom of the test tube. A small amount of saline will remain in the tube. Resuspend cells in remaining saline by pipetting in and out. (If needed, 30 \u00b5l of saline solution may be added to facilitate resuspension.) Withdraw 30 \u00b5l of cell suspension, and add to tube containing 100 \u00b5l of Chelex. Vortex to mix. Boil cell sample for 10 minutes. Use boiling water bath, heat block, or program thermal cycler for 10 minutes at 99\u00b0C. Then, cool tube briefly on i ice (optional). After boiling, vortex tube. Place in a balanced configuration in a microcentrifuge, and spin for 30 sec. Transfer 30 \u00b5l of supernatant (containing the DNA) to clean 1.5 ml tube. Avoid cell debris and Chelex beads. This sample will be used for setting up one or more PCR reactions. Store your sample on ice or in the freezer until ready to begin Part II.

Pool reagents by pulsing in a microcentrifuge or by sharply tapping tube bottom on lab bench. Label the cap of your tube with a number, as assigned by your teacher. In this way, your results will be anonymous. Store all samples on ice until ready to amplify according to the following profile. Program thermal cycler for 30 cycles according to the following cycle profiles. Each program may be linked to a 4\u00b0C to hold samples after completing the cycle profile, but amplified DNAs also hold well at room temperature.

In every laboratory, there are lab notebooks and they are the most important record of your work. A lab notebook is the authoritative record of how experiments were performed, and the data they generated. Here are some points to remember for our lab notebooks. Note A notebook is not your own. In a laboratory the notebook belongs to the PI (primary investigator), the person who runs the laboratory. Notebook entries should be neatly written in pen (not pencil). If needed, the notebook may also be typed. If an error is made, it should be neatly crossed out. The point is that there should be a permanent record that is unalterable. In cases of scientific fraud notebooks may be checked. Every page of the notebook (or every new entry) should have a date. We will also have a title for the various entries in our lab notebooks. There are usually two types of entries: Lab demos: Are demonstrations of techniques. You will take notes but not not necessarily do the experiment yourself. Labs: These are full labs where you and lab partners will preform the experiment. In many cases you will be provided a protocol for the lab. You should still copy the protocol into your notebook with annotations as to what you observed and notes if the protocol is modified in any way. Photos, sketches, and any other records or results should be entered in your notebook. How to use protocols in this camp Protocols posted here are typically outlines, meaning that while they contain high-level details, they are not a substitute for taking your own notes during lab. You should copy protocols into you notebook, leaving ample room for your own notes. Note Unless otherwise noted, protocols are from/adapted from the DNA Learning Center . Questions your lab notes should answer For major steps, include your notes on what is happening; what is the purpose of this step? Include your observations; is there a color change? can I sketch or include a photo of what is happening? Don't just say what you did, say what you saw. Document differences. Did the instructor say I should expect to see something I am not seeing? Did I make a mistake and add too much/little of a reagent? Include details so if something goes wrong, you can work out why that might be. Be objective; when I make descriptions am I giving estimates using objective measurable terms? For example: \"I see a ~ 3 mm pellet\", \"I collected a sample of approximately 10 grams\". Even if you don't have a scale or ruler you can give your best detailed estimates.

Understanding Safety in the lab One of the most important responsibilities in the lab is to conduct experiments safely. We owe it to ourselves and our colleagues to be sure that our experiments are conducted in a way that does not engager health. Importantly for our course we will not be working with chemicals, materials, or techniques that pose any significant threats. Nevertheless, 'sola dosis facit venenum'. We may at times work with open flames and sharp objects. It is important that every student make themselves familiar with possible safety risks and hazards. You may one day work in a laboratory (especially when doing independent research) where there are chemicals or instruments that do pose risks (even at school there are items in our storage that may be dangerous if mishandled). You must take responsibility, because you may not always be informed by others. To help us know how to understand these dangers we will consider the MSDS and Fire Diamond. Basic safety rules Safety is everyone's responsibility - you are responsible for keeping safe and for speaking up if you see something unsafe. Know what PPE is required and when and review MSDS for unfamiliar materials. No food or drink in any laboratory settings. Never walk away from an open flame. Ask for help when you are uncertain. SDS/MSDS and Fire Safety All chemicals in the laboratory have a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) (also called a Safety Data Sheet) associated with them. This document explains the potential safety risks associated with the chemical and what to do if you are exposed to the chemical. You can search \"chemical name\" + \"safety data sheet\" to find this information online if you don't know where this information is in the lab. You can also use a website such as chemicalsafety.com . Fire safety Even if we don't work with flammable chemicals, it's important to know some rules.

Carol Carter Dr. Carter joined the Stony Brook University (SBU) faculty as a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of Molecular Genetics & Microbiology, School of Medicine, after graduating from the City College of New York (Phi Beta Kappa), earning her PhD at Yale U and completing postdoctoral studies in virus replication and protein biochemistry at the Roche Institute of Molecular Biology. At SBU, she advanced through the ranks to Professor and is an Adjunct Professor in the Department of Physiology & Biophysics. Dr. Carter leads a federally funded basic research program focused on the pathogenesis of AIDS and other viral-induced diseases and has served on the editorial boards of journals in her field and federal, state and private advisory committees. Her research centers on cellular protein trafficking mechanisms necessary for production of virus particles and how they might be targeted for anti-viral drug design. Aspects of her work have been exhibited in the Museum of Science & Technology (Chicago IL, 2000) and translated into issued or pending patent/licenses. Dr. Carter was a featured speaker at the \u201cWomen in Science\u201d workshop sponsored by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (Japan, 2006), is a member of several SBU Graduate and Medical Sciences Training Programs in Infectious Diseases, Cancer, and Genetics and has participated in teaching of undergraduate, graduate, medical, and dental students. She has been the recipient of the \u201cSBU Exceptional Service to Undergraduate Education\u201d award, was recognized by the office of the SBU President for her service in initiatives promoted by the Center for Inclusive Education, received the 2016 Suffolk County Public Service award and, for her translational work, the 2017 Long Island Innovator award. She gratefully acknowledges the enthusiastic support and encouragement of the CSHL Director David Micklos and Assistant Director Jason Williams, without whose talents, dedication and commitment this opportunity could not have been developed. Brittany Johnson Brittany is a Middle School Educator at the DNA Learning Center. She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Biology from Fisk University, and a Master of Biological Medical Sciences from Mississippi College. Brittany\u2019s involvement with the DNALC began when she attended school trips and participated in a Summer DNA Program creating antibiotic resistant genes held at Central Islip High School. She was grateful for the teachers who made sure she and others had the opportunity and exposure to this style of learning. Later, while volunteering in the then Central Islip School District (CISD) Mulligan Science Center a DNALC Educator came to do a lab, eventually leading her to pursue an opportunity to start a career with the DNALC team. The DNA Learning Center sparked an interest she never forgot, and as an educator, it is her aspiration to encourage critical thinking, while creating an environment and an excitement for learning. Joeli Marrero My life story follows a trajectory like that of my mitochondrial DNA: a circle with lots of twists and turns. My story begins in Puerto Rico where I grew up climbing trees and exploring lush nature. After spending my childhood immersed in muddy puddles and endless forest trails, I naturally went to the University of Puerto Rico, Cayey to study biology. Up in the misty mountains of Cayey, I had the luck to be selected to participate in many undergraduate research programs; these programs introduced me to the world of research, which stretches beyond my warm and cozy island. I traveled the world pursuing my scientific training and, along the way, I completed my Ph.D. in molecular biology and microbiology and a post-doc in immunology. On this journey, I have acquired many amazing friends from all corners of the world. Scientific training does not have an endpoint, as it moves with the frontier of knowledge, and like Universe, it is in constant expansion. Conversely, scientific training never ceases, which I discovered when I left the workforce to raise my children. During this phase, I briefly taught college undergraduates, wrote medical documents for a big pharma, and worked in a library. However, during this phase I primarily did one thing: raise my children from sun-up to sun-down. Being a full-time, stay-at-home mom is the hardest job I have ever done, but I have to say that looking back it has been the most important job that I have ever done. I can honestly say that I did not plan on taking that important job, but it was my heart that led me to it. After all my kids started school full-time, I took the leap to return to the workforce. And with that leap, I continued to follow my heart on this circle, which is full of twist and turns. This journey took me back to the place I love, which is a place of free science exploration and learning. Alas, luck struck again, and I landed a job at the DNA Learning Center to teach hands-on science to students. I am honored to join the DNA Learning Center team to teach and promote DNA science literacy. You may ask: \u201cWhy study DNA?\u201d I would answer that question with another question: \u201cWould you like to learn how to read the book of life?\u201d If your answer is \u201cYes,\u201d then my dear reader, hold my hand and allow me to take you inside a cell and find a copy of the most ancient written story, a lengthy chronicle written with only four characters: AGTC. This chronicle retells the story of where you came from, while it also contains the recipe to make every single part of you; and perhaps, your DNA book may contain some yet unknown secrets about you. And maybe, your story also has twist and turns just like DNA; and like a circle, it takes you back to the place you love. I hope to meet you there. Ashley Paynter As a child, I was always extremely curious. My first exposure to biology was in the 9th grade and I immediately fell in love. I then applied to a NSF Science Research Mentoring program at the American Museum of Natural History, where I studied marine venomous snail toxins. I continued to be mentored at the museum throughout my college career, during summers as part of the NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates program where I investigated the genetic underlyings of a contagious cancer in bivalves. In college at Binghamton University, I worked in a Lyme disease research laboratory and campaigned as an environmental rights activist to ban fracking in the Southern Tier of New York. In 2017 I moved across the country to Seattle to pursue my Ph.D. in biology at University of Washington. During my time at UW, I studied early detection of cancer and comparative oncology. I investigated precancerous mutations in dogs to better understand somatic mutagenesis and aging. I also became an advocate for health equity and diversity and inclusion in STEM. My goal is to make science more accessible, fun, and approachable for people of all backgrounds and ages. Advisors and Supporters Thank you to the various supporters who have made it possible for us to make this idea a reality. Their support enabled us to refine our ideas for the camp, recruit students, and develop the curriculum. We also want to acknowledge others possibly not listed here who contributed in other ways including teachers and advisors who helped spread the word, administrators who helped distribute flyers, and anyone else who helped behind the scenes. David Micklos David Micklos is the Founder and Executive Director of the Cold Spring Harbor DNA Learning Center. His support has made it possible for us to hold this first year of the STARS program without any external funding for supplies and staff time. He originally conceived of the idea of holding a dedicated DNALC camp that would serve to support underrepresented students in STEM and embraced the opportunity to collaborate with Professor Carter and her colleagues at Stony Brook University, who were seeking a setting for such an initiative.

She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Biology from Fisk University, and a Master of Biological Medical Sciences from Mississippi College. Brittany\u2019s involvement with the DNALC began when she attended school trips and participated in a Summer DNA Program creating antibiotic resistant genes held at Central Islip High School. She was grateful for the teachers who made sure she and others had the opportunity and exposure to this style of learning. Later, while volunteering in the then Central Islip School District (CISD) Mulligan Science Center a DNALC Educator came to do a lab, eventually leading her to pursue an opportunity to start a career with the DNALC team. The DNA Learning Center sparked an interest she never forgot, and as an educator, it is her aspiration to encourage critical thinking, while creating an environment and an excitement for learning.","title":"Brittany Johnson"},{"location":"instructors/instructors/#joeli-marrero","text":"My life story follows a trajectory like that of my mitochondrial DNA: a circle with lots of twists and turns. My story begins in Puerto Rico where I grew up climbing trees and exploring lush nature. After spending my childhood immersed in muddy puddles and endless forest trails, I naturally went to the University of Puerto Rico, Cayey to study biology. Up in the misty mountains of Cayey, I had the luck to be selected to participate in many undergraduate research programs; these programs introduced me to the world of research, which stretches beyond my warm and cozy island. I traveled the world pursuing my scientific training and, along the way, I completed my Ph.D. in molecular biology and microbiology and a post-doc in immunology. On this journey, I have acquired many amazing friends from all corners of the world. Scientific training does not have an endpoint, as it moves with the frontier of knowledge, and like Universe, it is in constant expansion. Conversely, scientific training never ceases, which I discovered when I left the workforce to raise my children. During this phase, I briefly taught college undergraduates, wrote medical documents for a big pharma, and worked in a library. However, during this phase I primarily did one thing: raise my children from sun-up to sun-down. Being a full-time, stay-at-home mom is the hardest job I have ever done, but I have to say that looking back it has been the most important job that I have ever done. I can honestly say that I did not plan on taking that important job, but it was my heart that led me to it. After all my kids started school full-time, I took the leap to return to the workforce. And with that leap, I continued to follow my heart on this circle, which is full of twist and turns. This journey took me back to the place I love, which is a place of free science exploration and learning. Alas, luck struck again, and I landed a job at the DNA Learning Center to teach hands-on science to students. I am honored to join the DNA Learning Center team to teach and promote DNA science literacy. You may ask: \u201cWhy study DNA?\u201d I would answer that question with another question: \u201cWould you like to learn how to read the book of life?\u201d If your answer is \u201cYes,\u201d then my dear reader, hold my hand and allow me to take you inside a cell and find a copy of the most ancient written story, a lengthy chronicle written with only four characters: AGTC. This chronicle retells the story of where you came from, while it also contains the recipe to make every single part of you; and perhaps, your DNA book may contain some yet unknown secrets about you. And maybe, your story also has twist and turns just like DNA; and like a circle, it takes you back to the place you love. I hope to meet you there.","title":"Joeli Marrero"},{"location":"instructors/instructors/#ashley-paynter","text":"As a child, I was always extremely curious. My first exposure to biology was in the 9th grade and I immediately fell in love. I then applied to a NSF Science Research Mentoring program at the American Museum of Natural History, where I studied marine venomous snail toxins. I continued to be mentored at the museum throughout my college career, during summers as part of the NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates program where I investigated the genetic underlyings of a contagious cancer in bivalves. In college at Binghamton University, I worked in a Lyme disease research laboratory and campaigned as an environmental rights activist to ban fracking in the Southern Tier of New York. In 2017 I moved across the country to Seattle to pursue my Ph.D. in biology at University of Washington. During my time at UW, I studied early detection of cancer and comparative oncology. I investigated precancerous mutations in dogs to better understand somatic mutagenesis and aging. I also became an advocate for health equity and diversity and inclusion in STEM. My goal is to make science more accessible, fun, and approachable for people of all backgrounds and ages.","title":"Ashley Paynter"},{"location":"instructors/instructors/#advisors-and-supporters","text":"Thank you to the various supporters who have made it possible for us to make this idea a reality.
